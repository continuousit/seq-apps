Seq Apps
========

Apps for the [Seq](http://getseq.net) event server. You can find installable versions of these by searching for the [seq-app tag on NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=seq-app).

Currently in this repository you'll find:

 * **Email+** - send Seq events as email messages when they arrive (replaces the older _Email_ app package)
 * **File Archive** - copy incoming log events into a set of rolling text files
 * **First of Type** - raise an event the first time a new event type is seen
 * **Replication** - forward incoming events to another Seq server
 * **Thresholds** - raise an event if the frequency of matched events exceeds a threshold

**Please raise issues** for this project in the [main issue tracker](https://github.com/continuousit/seq-releases/issues).
